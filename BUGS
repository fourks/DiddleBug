BUGS
====

* DiddleBug will *not* work with AlarmHack.
  Users of PalmOS 3.x or greater should use 3AlarmHack, which I have been
  using successfully with DiddleBug.  People with PalmOS 2.x or earlier
  can try Snoozer, which has been reported to work.

* The PalmOS only checks for alarms once every 60 seconds when the
  machine if in sleep mode (or OFF).  Your alarms may be delayed by
  up to 60 seconds if the machine is off.
