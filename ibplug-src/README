Compiling the plugins
=====================

You can make the plugins individually in their directories by typing "make",
or you can compile them all in the main diddlebug directory by typing
"make plugins".


Making your own plugins
=======================

You can use the booger_template.pl script to create a new skeleton plugin.
Just fill in the extra stuff you want to do and compile. :)
